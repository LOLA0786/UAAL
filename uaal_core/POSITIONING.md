# UAAL — Fintech-first AI Accountability

UAAL is an enforcement layer that cryptographically records and proves AI decisions
in regulated financial systems.

If an AI action executes, policy compliance and immutable evidence must exist —
or the action is blocked.

## Built for fintech. Designed for regulated AI everywhere.

UAAL is deployed first in high-risk financial decisioning:
- Credit limits & pricing
- Underwriting & fraud approvals
- Automated risk decisions

The same enforcement model extends to other regulated AI domains:
- Insurtech (claims, premiums)
- Health AI (triage, clinical routing)
- HR tech (hiring, promotion decisions)
- E-commerce pricing
- Autonomous agents & internal enterprise AI
- Research integrity & reproducibility

## What UAAL is
- A pip-installable enforcement layer
- Inline decision gating (not post-hoc logs)
- Immutable, verifiable evidence chains
- Regulator-ready by design

## What UAAL is not
- A model
- A dashboard-first governance tool
- A replacement for your AI system

UAAL wraps existing AI systems and makes their decisions defensible.
